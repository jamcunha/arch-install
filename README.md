# Arch Install Script

A (still incomplete) Arch Linux install script that I will be using to facilitate installation on my devices.

With this project I intend to learn some bash script and how Arch works

## Things I plan to do

- ### Have a base install
  - [ ] Pre mount
  - [x] After mount
  - [x] Boot loader
  - [x] Network
  - [x] Audio (may need after install config)
  - [ ] Graphics drivers
  
- ### "Custom" install of packages (depending on what I will need on the device)
  - [x] AUR helper
  - [x] Login display manager

- ### A separate install for DE/WM
  - [ ] i3
