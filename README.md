# Arch Install Script

A (still incomplete) Arch Linux install script that I will be using to facilitate installation on my devices.

## Things I plan to do

- [ ] Have a base install
- [ ] "Custom" install of packages (depending on what I will need on the device)
- [ ] A separate install for DE/WM of my choice
