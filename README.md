# Arch Install Script

A (still incomplete) Arch Linux install script that I will be using to facilitate installation on my devices.

With this project I intend to learn some bash script and how Arch works

## Things I plan to do

- ### Have a base install
  - [ ] Pre mount
  - [x] After mount
  - [x] Boot loader
  - [x] Network
  
- ### "Custom" install of packages (depending on what I will need on the device)
  - [ ] (Still need to think about)

- ### A separate install for DE/WM
  - [ ] i3
